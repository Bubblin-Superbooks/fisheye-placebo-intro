# Fisheye-Placebo

Introducing - FISHEYE PLACEBO - a *first of its kind* modern day webcomics series.

## Summary

Living under an authoritarian regime is not fun. Extensive censorship meant no Facebook, no Youtube, and worse still â€” no porn. Fortunately for Vance, being a hacker meant scaling the Great Firewall was a walk in the park. With free web at his fingertips, Vance should have been happy. A hero on campus!  

But he is not happy. 

Fate has many plans for Vance, as he is dragged into a crazy conspiracy to overthrow the regime. Between failed dates, falling grades and a sinking feeling of being "caught" one day, Vance comes to question the morality of his own actions. And learns the true price of freedom.
