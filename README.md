# Fisheye-Placebo

Introducing - FISHEYE PLACEBO - a comicbook hack.

## Summary

Living under an authoritarian regime is not fun. Extensive censorship meant no Facebook, no Youtube, and worse still â€” no porn. Fortunately for Vance, being a hacker meant scaling the Great Firewall was easy. With free web at his fingertips, Vance should have been able to show off. Be happy. A hero on campus!  

But he is not. 

Fate has other plans for Vance, as he is dragged into a crazy conspiracy to overthrow the regime. Between failed dates, falling grades and that sinking feeling of being "caught" one day, Vance comes to question the morality of his actions. And learns the true price of freedom.
